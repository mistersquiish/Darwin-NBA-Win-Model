# NBA Seasonal Record Model Using SparkCognition's Supervised Learning Module

Repository with all the files/jupyter notebooks my team used for analysis on NBA statistics from 2009-2019. Project was for our CS 329e Data Analytics project.

Overview:
We took the problem of determining how to properly evaluate NBA playoff teams and decided to build models that used regular season statistics, along with other important features, to attempt to predict what an NBA team’s record should have been. By building such a model, bettors can bet on undervalued teams and against overvalued teams.

SparkCognition provided usernames and passwords to use their cloud based data science tool― Darwin.
